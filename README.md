# Real-Time Keylogging and Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a non-intrusive, real-time keylogging system that captures and displays user input on PCs. The system is designed to improve security, ensure compliance with usage policies, and enhance productivity monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time keystroke capture
- Secure data transmission to a central server
- User-friendly interface for real-time display of keystrokes
- Data encryption for secure storage and transmission
- Minimal performance impact on the monitored systems

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
- `requests` library
- `tkinter` library (usually included with Python)

### Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pynput requests cryptography

## RUN THE PROJECT BY
```python keylogger.py
##you see the output
